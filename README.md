## Ideas for Lorentz Map
# -----------------------------------------------
# data folding for determining 
    - distance between peaks
# measuring in terms of general coordinates
    - theta for the 2d plots
    - theta and phi for 3d plots
    - fitting a trig function to the zt vs t plot
    - discrete fourier transform on each coordinate
# measuing in terms of a positional average
# 




## Ideas for perturbation step
# -------------------------------
# modify the driver
# signals
    - functions for standard signals 
    - bigass array for the random one add it to the dumb stupid class
